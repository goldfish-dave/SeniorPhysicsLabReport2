\section{Introduction}

The aim of this experiment was to measure the conductivity of a thin film of copper wrt. thickness. The introduction deals with the concepts of evaporation and sputtering deposition techniques, as well as a technique for measuring thin film thickness. The procedure outlines how the required vacuum was obtained and conductivity was measured. The results are represented by a chart of Resistance Vs Thickness and is accompanied by some discussion, followed by conclusions.

\subsection{Evaporation Deposition}

The basica principle of Evaporation Deposition is to evaporate a metal (in this case aluminium) and allow it to condense on the target substrate. This forms an even coating of aluminium on the substrate. 

In more detail, the evaporation is done in a vacuum chamber. This is to avoid gas particles other than the aluminium being present and interfering with the process. The way the aluminium is boiled is by wrapping it around tungsten, which is then short circuited to provide heat. Since the melting point for tungsten is greater than the boiling point for aluminium, the tungsten is a suitable metal for the process.

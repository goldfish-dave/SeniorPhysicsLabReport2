\maketitle

The aim of this experiment was to measure the conductivity of a thin film of copper wrt. thickness. The introduction deals with the concepts of evaporation and sputtering deposition techniques, as well as a technique for measuring thin film thickness. The procedure outlines how the required vacuum was obtained and conductivity was measured. The results are represented by a chart of Resistance Vs Thickness and is accompanied by some discussion, followed by conclusions.
